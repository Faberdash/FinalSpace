# FinalSpace
An under-construction "Space Invaders" type 2D game. A single level was implemented, all contributions to Styling and Adding Levels are welcomed :)

The game controls are fairly simple, You move with the arrows: <-- --> and Shoot with the space bar

Each object has its own header file in Dependencies, along with all its methods.

Once the score reaches 10 the game closes, if you get hit by a meteor once you lose.
